<h4>What is a Resource Group?</h4>

<h3>Creating Your First Resource Group</h3>

*If you hit Next: Tags, you can observe and place a tag of your own, however, we will not be specifying any Tags for this. Tags are used for additional organization inside the resource group such as naming the creators of a certain files within the group.*

Step 4: After you're done reviewing, hit "Create" again at the bottom of the screen to create the Resource Group. You should now see your newly created Resource Group on the list.

<h4>What is a Storage Account?</h4>
